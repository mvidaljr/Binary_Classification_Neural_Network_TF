# Binary Classification with Neural Network using TensorFlow

## Project Overview

This project involves building a binary classification model using a neural network with TensorFlow. The objective is to accurately classify data into one of two categories, showcasing the power of deep learning for binary classification tasks.

## Dataset

- **Source:** The dataset consists of features that can be used to classify observations into two categories.
- **Target:** The target variable is binary, representing the two classes for prediction.

## Tools & Libraries Used

- **Data Analysis:**
  - `Pandas` for data manipulation and analysis.
  - `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn` for data visualization.
- **Neural Network Development:**
  - `TensorFlow` and `Keras` for building and training the neural network model.
- **Model Evaluation:**
  - Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate model performance.

## Methodology

### Data Exploration:

- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of features and their relationship with the target variable.

### Data Preprocessing:

- Normalized numerical features and encoded categorical variables.
- Balanced the dataset if necessary, using techniques like oversampling or undersampling.

### Model Development:

- Built a binary classification neural network using TensorFlow and Keras, consisting of multiple layers with activation functions like ReLU and Sigmoid.
- Applied techniques such as dropout and batch normalization to enhance model generalization.

### Learning Rate Tuning:

- **Learning Rate Examples:**
  - **High Learning Rate (0.1):** The model converges quickly but may overshoot the optimal solution, leading to unstable training and poor generalization.
  - **Medium Learning Rate (0.01):** Provides a balanced approach, allowing the model to converge steadily without overshooting, leading to better accuracy and stability.
  - **Low Learning Rate (0.001):** Converges slowly but ensures more precise adjustments to the model’s weights, potentially improving accuracy but requiring more training epochs.

- Experimented with different learning rates to find the optimal balance between convergence speed and model accuracy.

### Model Training:

- Trained the model using binary cross-entropy as the loss function and the Adam optimizer with a tunable learning rate.
- Monitored performance using validation data to prevent overfitting.

### Model Evaluation:

- Evaluated the model on a test set using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Plotted confusion matrix and ROC curve to visualize performance.

## Results

The neural network model effectively classified the data into the correct categories. Tuning the learning rate had a significant impact on the model’s convergence and overall performance, with a medium learning rate yielding the best results.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the capability of neural networks for binary classification tasks. Adjusting the learning rate was crucial for optimizing model performance and achieving high accuracy.

## Future Work

- Further refine the learning rate schedule, potentially implementing adaptive learning rates or learning rate annealing.
- Experiment with different neural network architectures and hyperparameter tuning.
- Deploy the model in a real-world application for automated decision-making.
